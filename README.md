# event scoring database
This project was designed to record, display, and generate reports for a competition with multiple events, scores, and competitors.  It was specifically designed and branded for the Santee Cooper Annual Lineworkers Rodeo which usually consists of two tiers of competition, one for teams and one for individuals, each with 5 events and associated scores and completion times.  The project will calculate individual scores, average scores per event, average scores overall, resolve score ties using fastest completion time as the tie-breaker, and generate the following reports:
- Top three competitors per event (both tiers)
- Top three competitors overall (both tiers)
- Overall results including scores and times for all competitors in all tiers for all events
